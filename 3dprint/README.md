# PiHome Case
Adapted from Raspberry Pi Media Streamer By Paul Arden

## Description

You don't have to use any of these files, but they are here if you want them.  I wish I could take credit for designing this model, but I can't.   Please see the plexamp-pi
project on github for more information: https://github.com/ardenpm/plexamp-pi

I have downloaded these files from the above project and modified them to fit my needs.  The 3MF files here are the ones I used to print my case.

# Knob Controls

The PiHome will work without the knob controls, but they are nice to have.  You **DO NOT** need to use or print your own case.  You can very well use an over the counter case without knob controls/rotary rencoder. 

## Rotary Encoder

If you do connect a rotary encoder/knob controls Please note that PiHome expects the following pins to be used:

* Pin 17 - Rotary Encoder A
* Pin 18 - Rotary Encoder B
* Pin 27 - Rotary Encoder Switch

The Power (+) is connected to the 3V3 pin and the Ground (-) is connected a the Ground pin.
