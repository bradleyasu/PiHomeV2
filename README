### MQTT Payload Definitions

If configured, PiHome can subscribe to MQTT feeds and react to events. 

Three types of events can be sent to PiHome

- Notification.  A notification will appear on screen until dismissed
- Display.  A display will be a full screen UI overlay
- App Trigger.  This event will trigger an app, if it exists, in PiHome.  For example, if you would like an uber app to be triggered when an event is pushed
to the MQTT feed

The payloads for these events should respect the following.

Notification
```json
{
    "type": "notificaiton",
    "color": "<(r,g,b,a)>",
    "icon": "<icon_url>",
    "title": "<title>",
    "message": "<message>"
}
```

Display
```json
{
    "type": "display",
    "background": "<(r,g,b,a)>",
    "title": "<title>",
    "message": "<message>",
    "image": "<image_url>
}
```

App Trigger
```json
{
    "type": "app",
    "key": "<app key>" // Not app name!
}
```
